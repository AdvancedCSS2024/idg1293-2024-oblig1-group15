The oblig did not specify were we should place images and icons used, so a new folder called images was created inside assets for this.

Fabric says H1 should be 34px/2.125rem, but the actual website's log in page H1 uses 1.5rem.

Finn uses typefaces exclusively owned by them, so we had to find a free typeface that looked similar. Wix Madefor Display from Google Font was chosen.

Can't find any way to download the icons used by Finn.
